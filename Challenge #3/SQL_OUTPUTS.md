## Case Study Questions


This case study is split into an initial data understanding question before diving straight into data analysis questions before finishing with 1 single extension challenge.


## A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

## C. Challenge Payment Question


The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan

upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately

upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period

once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
Example outputs for this table might look like the following:

## D. Outside The Box Questions


The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!


How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

** THE RATE OF GROWTH FOR FOODIE-FI CAN BE CALCULATED BY TAKING A LOOK INTO FOLLOWING
    ## HOW MANY NUMBER OF PAID CUSTOMERS ARE THERE IN THE SYSTEM TAKING TIME REFERENCE
    ## ARE THE SET TARGETS OF FOODIE-FI BEING MET?
    ## HOW IS THE COMPANY SEEMS TO BE DOING WITH REFERENCE TO ITS COMPETITORS?

What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?


** NET REVENUE
** CUSTOMER RETENTION PERCENTAGE
**LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS TO KNOW THE LOCALE RANGE OF THE COMPANY


What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?


** MOST TO LEAST POPULAR SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGES
** CUSTOMER SERVICE RATINGS
** TEXT ANALYSIS FOR CUSTOMER REVIEWS (MOST USED WORDS)


If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

** WHAT IS THE REASON FOR QUITTING (OPTIONS: CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICING, BETTER OPTIONS IN THE MARKET,ETC)

What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?



** HOLIDAY SCHEMES  
** PARTNERSHIP WITH UPIs, SIM COMPANY TO PUT ADD ONS AS 'FOODIE-FI' IN THEIR SUBSCRIPTION MODEL
		# FOR EXAMPLE AIRTEL SELLS 3 MONTH SUBSCRIPTION OF HOTSTAR IN THEIR RS 766 RECHARGE PACKAGE
** EXIT SURVEY ANALYSIS AND REFINEMENT

*** WE CAN VALIDATE EACH EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE IDEAS BY MONITORING THE SUBSCRIPTION SALES DURING THESE SCHEMES

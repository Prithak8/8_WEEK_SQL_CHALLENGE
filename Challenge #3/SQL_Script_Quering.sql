-- C. Challenge Payment Question



-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020
-- that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with 
-- the following requirements:

-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original 
-- start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid 
-- amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current 
-- billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
-- Example outputs for this table might look like the following:



CREATE TABLE payments AS
SELECT s.customer_id,
       s.plan_id,
       p.plan_name,
       CASE
           WHEN s.plan_id = 0 THEN DATE_ADD(s.start_date, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
           WHEN s.plan_id = 1 THEN DATE_ADD(DATE_FORMAT(s.start_date, '%Y-%m-01'), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
           WHEN s.plan_id = 2 THEN DATE_ADD(DATE_FORMAT(s.start_date, '%Y-%m-01'), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
           WHEN s.plan_id = 3 THEN LAST_DAY(DATE_ADD(s.start_date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR))
       END AS payment_date,
       CASE
           WHEN s.plan_id = 0 THEN 0
           WHEN s.plan_id = 1 THEN p.price
           WHEN s.plan_id = 2 THEN p.price
           WHEN s.plan_id = 3 THEN p.price / 12
       END AS amount,
       CASE
           WHEN s.plan_id = 0 THEN 0
           WHEN s.plan_id = 1 THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date)
           WHEN s.plan_id = 2 THEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date)
           WHEN s.plan_id = 3 THEN 12
       END AS payment_order

-- D. Outside The Box Questions
-- The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical 
-- interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers 
-- that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing 
-- impression!

-- How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?


	## THE RATE OF GROWTH FOR FOODIE-FI CAN BE CALCULATED BY TAKING A LOOK INTO FOLLOWING
    ## HOW MANY NUMBER OF PAID CUSTOMERS ARE THERE IN THE SYSTEM TAKING TIME REFERENCE
    ## ARE THE SET TARGETS OF FOODIE-FI BEING MET?
    ## HOW IS THE COMPANY SEEMS TO BE DOING WITH REFERENCE TO ITS COMPETITORS?
    
    
    

-- What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to 
-- assess performance of their overall business?

# NET REVENUE
# CUSTOMER RETENTION PERCENTAGE
# LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS TO KNOW THE LOCALE RANGE OF THE COMPANY


-- What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further 
-- to improve customer retention?

# MOST TO LEAST POPULAR SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGES
# CUSTOMER SERVICE RATINGS
# TEXT ANALYSIS FOR CUSTOMER REVIEWS (MOST USED WORDS)

-- If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to 
-- cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

# WHAT IS THE REASON FOR QUITTING (OPTIONS: CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRICING, BETTER OPTIONS IN THE MARKET,ETC)



-- What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? 
-- How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?


# HOLIDAY SCHEMES  
# PARTNERSHIP WITH UPIs, SIM COMPANY TO PUT ADD ONS AS 'FOODIE-FI' IN THEIR SUBSCRIPTION MODEL
		# FOR EXAMPLE AIRTEL SELLS 3 MONTH SUBSCRIPTION OF HOTSTAR IN THEIR RS 766 RECHARGE PACKAGE
# EXIT SURVEY ANALYSIS AND REFINEMENT

# WE CAN VALIDATE EACH EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE IDEAS BY MONITORING THE SUBSCRIPTION SALES DURING THESE SCHEMES
